# FlowersApp

The FlowersApp is a simple CRUD Angular App that connects to a Mongo database. It is an exercise in following best practices used in modern, professional development teams.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.2.

## Best Practices

This project uses the following practices:

- Version control *committing early and often!*
- Continuous integration *using TravisCI*
- Trunk-based development
- **Test Driven Development**
  - Using Karma
  - Tests can be run extremely frequently and reliably
- Loosely coupled architecture
  - There is an abstraction layer between the database and the UI

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
